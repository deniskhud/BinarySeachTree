# Binary Search Tree (BST)

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. A Binary Search Tree is a data structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements.

## Description

A Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree where for each node, the following condition holds:
- All values in the left subtree are smaller than the value of the parent node.
- All values in the right subtree are greater than the value of the parent node.

### Core Operations:
- **Insert**: Adds an element to the tree.
- **Remove**: Removes an element from the tree.
- **Find**: Checks if an element exists in the tree.
- **Min/Max**: Finds the minimum and maximum elements in the tree.
- **Inorder Traversal**: Displays the elements of the tree in sorted order.
